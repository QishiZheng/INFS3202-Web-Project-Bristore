What is Bristore
###################
Bristore is a simple B2C Ecommerce website developed using PHP.
In the development of this project, CodeIgniter MVC framworkd was used. I added module extension to Codeigniter in order to adapt the web application to a HMVC structure. For the authentication, I was using Ion Auth by Ben Edmunds.
